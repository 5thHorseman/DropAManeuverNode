# DropAManeuverNode
KSP Mod: Buttons to drop a maneuver node at orbital milestones

# LICENSE:
MIT (To match that of KSPCasher, whose Stock Toolbar code I used)

# ATTRIBUTION:
This project uses code for Stock Toolbar support from KSPCasher https://github.com/armazac/kspcasher

# CHANGELOG:
- 0.1: (Current) Initial build.
  - Stock Toolbar support.
  - Buttons to add a maneuver node at certain orbital milestones.
    
# BUGS:
- Several of the buttons don't work, or I don't know what they do yet.
  
# TO DO:
- Save/load settings, like window placement.
- Blizzy's Toolbar support
- Detect when things are not available (like no Ap due to escape) and disable the appropriate button.
- Detect when a maneuver node is already present (Within a few seconds?) and disable the appropriate button.
- Better UI
- "Move the next maneuver node" mode (toggle?).
- Basic thrust options like "circularize" or "match tilt" or "kill velocity"
- "Undo" (may be difficult or impossible)
- Automation options, like "place a circularization burn at Ap whenever you leave atmosphere."
